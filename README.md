# Practical Introduction to Llama 2 Fine-Tuning

Welcome to the GitHub repository for fine-tuning the Llama 2 model using QLoRA on a T4 GPU. This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a large language model with limited VRAM, making efficient use of advanced parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques.

## Overview

Fine-tuning a 7B parameter Llama 2 model presents significant challenges due to VRAM limitations. This repository explores the use of QLoRA, a method that allows for significant reductions in VRAM requirements by fine-tuning in 4-bit precision. This project is implemented within the Hugging Face ecosystem, utilizing libraries such as `transformers`, `accelerate`, `peft`, `trl`, and `bitsandbytes`.

## Prerequisites

- Access to Google Colab or a local setup with an NVIDIA GPU (T4 or better recommended).
- Python 3.8 or newer.

# Configuration and Setup

## Library Overview

- **Transformers**: Utilized for loading and using pre-trained models and tokenizers.
- **Accelerate**: Helps in simplifying the operation of models on multiple GPUs.
- **PEFT**: Supports parameter-efficient training methods like LoRA.
- **TRL**: Provides trainers for reinforcement learning setups.
- **BitsAndBytes**: Implements custom low-level optimizations for model training, especially for low-precision (4-bit) training.

## Preparing the Dataset

Load the dataset `mlabonne/guanaco-llama2-1k` using Hugging Face's `datasets` library:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset('mlabonne/guanaco-llama2-1k', split='train')
